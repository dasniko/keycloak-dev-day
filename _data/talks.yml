  title: "Mastering Access Control: Low-Code Authorization with ReBAC, Decoupling Patterns and Policy as Code"
  speaker: embesozzi
  abstract: |
    The talk shows the integration between Keycloak and OpenFGA for Fine-Grained Authorization based on ReBAC.
    Both platforms are integrated with a custom extension where the authorization model is synchronized.
    As the PEP (Policy Enforcement Point), I added an identity-aware API gateway (Apache APISIX) to enforce authorization and decouple it from the backend.
    The gateway uses a custom plugin that supports Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC) policies.
    Based on this approach, the goal was to implement Policy as Code (PaC), decouple authorization logic, and offer Low-Code Authorization.

  title: "Strengthening Security in Keycloak: An Introduction to the Shared Signals Framework"
  speaker: thomasdarimont
  abstract: |
    As security threats become more sophisticated, the need for efficient, real-time communication between identity providers and relying parties is essential. The Shared Signals Framework (SSF) and related specifications such as CAEP and RISC address this challenge by providing a standardised way for systems to exchange security related signals, such as session revocations, credential breaches, and other identity-related incidents, in a secure and scalable manner.
    <br/>This talk introduces the Shared Signals Framework and explains how it enhances security and operational efficiency in modern identity ecosystems. We'll explore how SSF can be supported in Keycloak to enable real-time event-driven communication between providers and relying parties. Attendees will learn how Keycloak can help to detect and mitigate threats, and improve overall system security with SSF.

  title: "Lightweight and Repeatable Integration Testing of Keycloak Extensions"
  speaker: frademacher
  abstract: |
    Keycloak extensions are often required to interact with the APIs of other systems, e.g., for the migration of customers from CRM systems to Keycloak users or for progressive profiling.
    While Keycloak's potential for such interactions is an important business requirement, it also calls for integration testing and thus makes extension testing more challenging:
    How to set up and maintain repeatable testing environments? How to ensure continued availability of such environments and still keep the maintenance effort low?
    How to mock other systems for which only their APIs and access to their production environments is known, but that do not provide any support for testing interactions with external parties?
    The talk goes into these issues based on experiences with the development of a real-world, non-trivial Keycloak extension for user migration. Specifically, the talk presents
    (i) ingredients to set up repeatable integration testing environments for Keycloak extensions with the Testcontainers framework; (ii) the automation of such setups so that local testing becomes possible; and (iii) Testcontainers Modules for flexible API mocking, and verifying custom scopes and claims in OIDC tokens.
    To this end, the talk focuses on a stripped down use case from the real-world Keycloak extension, in which a users logs into another system by means of a dedicated login form whose authenticator checks the user's credentials with the other system and in case of success creates a corresponding Keycloak user ("implicit user migration").

  title: "Keycloak's Compliance with Security Specifications : from OAuth 2.0, OIDC to OID4VCI"
  speaker: tnorimat
  abstract: |
    Supporting security specifications (standards) is important for Keycloak especially if we use Keycloak in our services and Keycloak have supported many security specifications (standards).
    In a first of this talk Takashi describes the meaning of supporting a security specification and propose a level of assurance of conformity with specifications.
    Takashi also tells which security specifications Keycloak supported.
    In a last half of this talk, Takashi picks up one specification among them: OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OID4VCI).
    In Europe, interest in De-centralized Identity (DID) and Self-sovereign identity (SSI) are increasing as the European Commission released "The European Digital Identity Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework" for eIDAS 2.0.
    The latest Keycloak supported an experimental feature OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI) for this emerging paradigm of identity by keycloak's community like OAuth SIG.
    Takashi describes the latest updates about OID4VCI support and describes how to use Keycloak to issue a Verifiable Credential in detail.

  title: "kcwarden: Finding and Fixing Keycloak Config Issues"
  speaker: malexmave
  abstract: |
    Keeping a complex Keycloak configuration secure is no easy feat. Configuration drift and unintended changes can turn what was once a secure configuration into one that is wide open to attacks - and taking stock of a configuration that has been created over multiple years of operation can be a daunting task.
    No matter if you are a administrating your own Keycloak or called in to perform a security audit, automation can be essential in ensuring you can quickly find and fix configuration issues, and detect new ones when they show up.
    We developed kcwarden, an Open Source tool that assists in finding common security issues and establishing custom guardrails that can alert you about dangerous configuration changes specific to your environment.
    In this talk, I will present how kcwarden can be used in your workflows. After the presentation, I'd be happy to get your views on the future direction of the tool in an Unconference session.

  title: "Five Deadly Sins When Using Keycloak for SSO"
  speaker: tmmmmmr
  abstract: |
    Over recent years, the threat landscape for highly targeted organizations has significantly evolved. When attackers fail to steal user credentials, they will pivot instead to stealing authentication proofs from users.
    OAuth, a widely adopted protocol, plays a crucial role in safeguarding against these threats. However, its effectiveness can be severely compromised by mis-implementations at both the application and authorization service levels.
    This presentation will cover the five most critical mistakes â€”""deadly sins""â€” committed by architects and developers when using Keycloak to implement SSO with OAuth. These errors can lead to the compromise of user sessions, making organizations vulnerable to attacks.
    Additionally, we will discuss current/upcoming improvements in the OAuth specification and implementation strategies that can mitigate these risks, and how Keycloak aligns with these practices.

  title: "KeyCloak Transient Users vs Corporate Security Policy - use case study for custom-flow Keycloak deployment"
  speaker: wkorlub
  abstract: |
    Transient Users in KeyCloak is a new (beta) feature that allows for the creation of users within a session, without the need to store them in the database.
    This functionality was designed with login architectures in mind where KeyCloak, as an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system, leverages external Identity Providers (IdPs).
    During our presentation, we will showcase a case study (use-case) that we implemented for a corporate client.
    We will share why this KeyCloak feature proved to be particularly useful in our scenario, explain how we implemented it, and discuss the lessons learned from integrating this feature into the overall project.

  title: "Enhancing Group Management in Keycloak: A Flexible Extension for Dynamic Membership Control"
  speaker:
    - cgeorgilakis
    - kozadinos
  abstract: |
    Overview: This presentation introduces an advanced group management extension for Keycloak, aimed at providing greater flexibility and control over group memberships. Our goal is to overcome the limitations of Keycloak's hierarchical groups and eventually integrate this extension into Keycloak's core features.
    <br/>Problem: Keycloak's current group system lacks essential capabilities, including the assignment of specific roles within groups, support for defining membership start and end dates, and functionality for tracking membership status, such as active, pending, or suspended.
    <br/>Solution: Our extension addresses these limitations with several key features. It enables distinct roles for members, allows admins to define when memberships activate and expire, and permits users to be manually updated or removed based on configuration. Membership status management includes full membership status, pre-configured future memberships, and temporary deactivation of membership.
    <br/>Empowering Group Administrators: This extension empowers group administrators by allowing them to manage their own and child groups independently, handle enrollment requests or invitations, and either manually or on-demand remove users from groups (versus automatically, once their membership expires), ensuring cleaner group management.
    <br/>Enhanced User Experience: To improve usability, new menus in user and admin consoles simplify group management. Automated email notifications inform users and admins about key events like invitations and membership changes.
    <br/>Development and Future Integration: Currently implemented as a Keycloak extension (plugin), this functionality allows for easy integration without core modifications. Given its significant value, we believe it should be considered for integration into Keycloak's core features. We will also demonstrate the code structure and how the extension interfaces with Keycloak's architecture.

  title: "Integration Testing of Keycloak Terraform Modules"
  speaker:
    - fboettcher
    - bbednarek
  abstract: |
    Using Terraform to automate provisioning and configuration of Keycloak implements a repeatable and version-controlled method to manage Keycloak.
    Additionally, reusable Terraform modules allow engineers to to provision resources like OIDC clients in their respective code repositories.
    To ensure a controlled, secure and predictable Keycloak setup, thorough testing is a crucial part of this architecture.
    In this talk, we will cover how to test and validate customized Keycloak setups by leveraging Kotlin-based integration tests.
    Using Kotlin's concise and expressive language features, we can write integration tests that confirm the correctness of the Terraform-provisioned Keycloak configurations.
    These tests will ensure that realms, authentication flows, and client settings behave as expected, reducing the risk of configuration errors in production.
