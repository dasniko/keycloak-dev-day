  speaker: ahus1
  room: Berlin
  abstract: |
    Keycloak delivers multiple updates every year. To benefit from new features, and to stay up to date with the latest security fixes, you need to upgrade.
    At the same time an upgrade might bring breaking changes and can lead to downtimes. So how should you approach this?
    <br/><br/>In this talk you'll learn how to upgrade with confidence in a timely manner and with less effort.
    <br/><br/>After a short recap of the latest Keycloak features, this talk shows how to navigate the release schedule of Keycloak and explains how preview and deprecated features work.
    It also shows how to prepare for the next upgrade using the resources provided by the Keycloak project, and what additional measures you should take in your deployment and test pipelines to smoothen the upgrade process.
    Finally, it will detail how you provide feedback to the Keycloak project ahead of an upcoming release.
- title: "Mastering Access Control: Low-Code Authorization with ReBAC, Decoupling Patterns and Policy as Code"
  speaker: embesozzi
  abstract: |
    The talk shows the integration between Keycloak and OpenFGA for Fine-Grained Authorization based on ReBAC.
    Both platforms are integrated with a custom extension where the authorization model is synchronized.
    As the PEP (Policy Enforcement Point), I added an identity-aware API gateway (Apache APISIX) to enforce authorization and decouple it from the backend.
    The gateway uses a custom plugin that supports Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC) policies.
    Based on this approach, the goal was to implement Policy as Code (PaC), decouple authorization logic, and offer Low-Code Authorization.

    In the evolving realm of Identity and Access Management (IAM), only the most skilled (event) sorcerers can harness the true power of "the Keycloak".
    <br/>Continue the epic journey from last years DevDay session "IAM Doomsday Prepper: Surviving the Apocalypse with Keycloak" and delve into the art of dynamic, replayable configuration through the power of event sourcing.
    <br/>Discover how to extend static configurations with sets of dynamic event driven configuration, making your IAM projects resilient against change and highly adaptable. Learn the secrets of coding, versioning, and replaying configurations, ensuring your Keycloak setup is robust, future-proof and, most of all, dynamic.
    <br/>Join us for a session that blends technical mastery with the lore of IAM, equipping you with the knowledge to wield dynamic configuration like a true sorcerer. By the end, your Keycloak projects will be fortified, ready to face any IAM challenge ahead.
- title: "Unlocking adaptive authentication with Keycloak"
  speaker: mabartos
  abstract: |
    As digital threats continuously evolve, traditional authentication methods often fall short and are insufficient in today's dynamic security landscape.
    It needs to adapt to different risk levels and ever-changing contexts, such as user location, device, and behavior, to ensure a secure and user-friendly experience.
    <br/>This presentation introduces the importance of adaptive authentication within Keycloak, showcasing how modern techniques combined with machine learning can transform identity and access management.
    <br/>This allows server administrators to detect anomalies and respond to emerging threats more effectively, ensuring that sensitive resources are protected. We provide step-by-step guidance and a demo on configuring and deploying these techniques in your Keycloak environment.
- title: "Cloud Native Keycloak"
  speaker: dschlosser
  abstract: |
    We run Keycloak in truly cloud native fashion: GitOps-Deployment to a Kubernetes Cluster (with Istio Service Mesh), Zero Downtime Upgrades even during peak usage times (~1200 Req/s with ~20 Mio users), extensive custom metrics and alerts, file-based realm configuration.
    <br/>In this talk I will deep dive into how we do it, what it took to get there and why we believe it was worth it and even try to push some of it upstream.
