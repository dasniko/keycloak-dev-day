  bio: |
    From a very young age I've been interested in computers and I wrote my first program at the age of 12 without owning a computer myself.
    Even today I'm always looking at new technologies, to see if we can solve things differently, maybe even better.
    Because I'm very enthusiastic about technology, I like to exchange thoughts and knowledge with others.
