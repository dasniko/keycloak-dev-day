                We are looking for your contribution to KEYCLOAK DevDay 2026!
            </p><p>
                If you want to give a proper talk at an awesome Community Conference, don't wait and submit your proposal today!
                The topic of your talk should be anything KEYCLOAK related.
                But keep in mind, that all the participants already know KEYCLOAK, there's no need to give some beginner/introduction talks.
                <!-- Also community-activities for our Open-Space/Unconference format can be submitted, e.g. discussions, Q&A sessions, etc. -->
            </p><p>
                We try to publish accepted talks in batches as they come in, but we can't promise.
                So better be fast in submitting your proposal to have the biggest chances to be among the selected speakers.
                <span class="d-inline-block text-danger">The CfP is only open until October 12, 2025!</span>
            </p><p class="small">
                As a speaker, you will get free access to the event.
                Please understand, that we can't cover any travel/accommodation costs, as we are a community conference and try to keep costs as low as possible.
                Thanks.
            </p>
